          <div style="padding-left: 2em;">
          This paper shows how the price of home heating can affect adverse birth outcomes when mothers are exposed to cold temperatures. To this end, I leverage geographical variation in the type of energy used for home heating, temporal variation in natural gas prices triggered by the fracking boom, and variation in exposure to cold temperatures. Using the universe of births in the US for 2001-2015, I find robust evidence that higher home-heating prices increase the risk of very preterm birth when pregnant women are exposed to cold temperatures. <be> 
            As a possible mechanism for this result, I examine the role of the "heat-and-eat" trade-off. When heating prices rise, households may use less heating. However, if the price elasticity of heating demand is less than one, energy spending will increase, reducing the budget for other goods. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that an increase in energy expenses leads to a reduction in food expenditures. The heterogeneity analyses reveal that the detrimental effect of higher heating prices is stronger in poorer counties and among non-Hispanic black, less-educated, and younger mothers. Back-of-the-envelope calculations imply the substantial reduction in natural gas prices in the late 2000s prevented approximately 2,200 very preterm births per year.

        The Effects of Low-Level Fluoride Exposure on Dental Health and Skill Formation (with Cheolmin Kang)　<em>[Draft coming soon]</em>　<br>
          <strong>[Abstract]</strong>
          <div style="padding-left: 2em;">
          Although water fluoridation is widely recognized as a substantially beneficial public health intervention, the appropriate fluoride dosage remains a topic of ongoing debate. We leverage quasi-exogenous variation in naturally occurring fluoride concentrations—driven by regional geological characteristics in Japan— combined with unique longitudinal data annually tracking individuals from birth, to examine the causal effects of childhood fluoride exposure at levels lower than those typically used in artificial fluoridation programs on dental health and human capital development. <br>
          First, we confirm that even at low concentrations, fluoride significantly improves a wide range of dental health outcomes, despite the widespread availability of alternative preventive measures such as fluoride toothpaste. Second, we find no evidence that fluoride exposure adversely affects educational attainment, contrary to concerns raised by prior studies examining higher dosages. Third, fluoride improves non-cognitive skills such as self-esteem, openness, and conscientiousness among females, but not males. The results support improved self-confidence in appearance and capacity to form healthy romantic relationships and friendships as the key mechanisms. <br>
          Our findings highlight that dental health can be an important determinant of non-cognitive skills, particularly for girls, through improvements in facial appearance. Moreover, they suggest increased fluoride exposure confers meaningful health and developmental benefits without impairing cognitive outcomes at low levels.
